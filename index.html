				<p>Let‚Äôs build together!</p>
				<p>My experience working as an Architectural Designer and my love for the design process has sculpted the way I
					tackle problems. The most direct path is oftentimes not the best path and only through refinement and
					iteration do we achieve the solution that‚Äôs ideal for the user or client. Funnily enough, this iterative
					mindset closely resembles my own career path, and my passion for creativity and technologies has led me to
					software engineering.</p>
				<p>Having a strong body is just as important as a strong mind. I love to stay active and this is reflected in
					the hobbies that I partake in. Throughout the weeknights I would be training and instructing in my martial
					arts. You will find me in the gym on weekend mornings and then on the volleyball court at night. For the more
					chill hobbies, I also like to go out fishing or spending time with friends on one of our favourite boardgames
					(these may not be that chill hahaha). </p>
				<p>I often find myself either reading or watching videos late into the night learning about a wide range of
					topics that interest me. Whether it be watching the latest <em>‚ÄúSmarter Every Day‚Äù</em> video or reading about
					how to
					transplant an avocado tree, my curiosity and craving for knowledge is never satisfied. I am immensely eager to
					learn and will jump at any opportunity to grow personally and professionally. </p>
				<p>If my curiosity has ignited yours, feel free to connect and chat!</p>

					<p>As the final project in our Software Engineering course, the class was given the task of building a web
						application of our choice using the knowledge and skills we
						have learnt throughout the course. I decided to build a beloved board game that my friends and I absolutely
						love: Machi Koro! </p>
					<p>I knew it would be impossible to recreate the full board game within the 4 day time frame that we had so I
						set on reducing and simplifying the scope until I knew I would be able to create a working game but still
						have
						enough to capture the essence of Machi Koro. I‚Äôm certainly glad that I did as it allowed me to reach
						MVP(Minimum Viable Product) early which gave allowed me plenty of time to tackle the many bugs. Best of all,
						I
						was then able to have fun by styling and adding extra little features üòä. </p>
					<p>This was a project that was driven by passion. I learnt so many things from working on this project, which
						has reaffirmed my strength and love for the front-end. I have included a little video demo of my project and
						also the link to the deployed webpage. Please keep in mind that the web app is purposed for a desktop screen
						as the game is intended to be played locally and for up to 4 players. </p>

					<p>The third project of the Software Engineering Immersive Course at General Assembly. This is a team project
						where the goal is to create a RESTful Single-Page Application(SPA) that will have CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and
						DELETE(CRUD) functionality. As our very first software development project, this task was the perfect
						opportunity to experience what it will be like to work collaboratively in the real world.</p>
					<p>The theme we have chosen is Pokemon and it will be a smaller version of the classic game. As a user, the
						goal of the game is to win battles in order to evolve the Pokemon and then have the ability to attain more
						Pokemon to complete the Pokedex. </p>
					<p>We learnt so much as a team and I particularly liked how we were able to share our knowledge where others
						might have gaps. One of the most challenging parts to the project was definitely managing the git flow. I am
						extremely proud of what my team and I have accomplished and I think it has definitely established a strong
						connection that will last through each of our careers. </p>

					<p>The goal for this project was to create a Full-stack application and I chose to design mine that has
						personal meaning and solves a real-world problem. </p>
					<p>The problem:<br />
						I am one of many instructors at my martial arts school and the school is spread across multiple locations
						throughout Brisbane, Australia. The classes are run throughout the week at different locations and
						communication on what happens at these classes are lacking. A few of the important information that should
						be kept on record would be what drills/exercises were completed, any new students that might be on trial,
						and any injuries that occurred during class. </p>
					<p>The Solution:<br />
						My idea was to create an Instructor Journal where the instructors could share what was done in the classes.
						This information could then be stored on a database and in the future can be recalled such as searching how
						many new students the school enrolled in that particular year, or checking whether how a student is feeling
						after a particular injury. </p>
					<p>Conclusions:<br />
						In the beginning, I had talked to my Sifu(teacher) about my idea and he loved it. Having a project for a
						real-world client is an amazing feeling. I cannot believe what was built in just 3 days and with more time,
						I would love to add additional features and be used consistently by the leadership group. Eventually, it'll
						have a library of drills and exercises and the planning feature for the app can be created.</p>

					<span class="image main"><img src="images/tictactoe.png" alt="" /></span>
					<p>As my first coding project at General Assembly, the task was to create the beloved TicTacToe game we all
						played as kids. It was extremely satisfying to be able to use what we have learnt in class on a live
						project. We have been learning how to use the tools, and in this first project, we are finally able to build
						something. </p>
					<p>The game is two players played locally (alternating turns). Disclaimer: The game currently is not optimised
						for mobile yet. </p>
