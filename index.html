				<p>Let’s build together!</p>
				<p>My experience working as an Architectural Designer and my love for the design process has sculpted the way I
					tackle problems. The most direct path is oftentimes not the best path and only through refinement and
					iteration do we achieve the solution that’s ideal for the user or client. Funnily enough, this iterative
					mindset closely resembles my own career path, and my passion for creativity and technologies has led me to
					software engineering.</p>
				<p>Having a strong body is just as important as a strong mind. I love to stay active and this is reflected in
					the hobbies that I partake in. Throughout the weeknights I would be training and instructing in my martial
					arts. You will find me in the gym on weekend mornings and then on the volleyball court at night. For the more
					chill hobbies, I also like to go out fishing or spending time with friends playing one of our favourite
					boardgames
					(these may not be that chill hahaha). </p>
				<p>I often find myself either reading or watching videos late into the night learning about a wide range of
					topics that interest me. Whether it be watching the latest <em>“Smarter Every Day”</em> video or reading about
					how to
					transplant an avocado tree, my curiosity and craving for knowledge is never satisfied. I am immensely eager to
					learn and will jump at any opportunity to grow personally and professionally. </p>
				<p>If my curiosity has ignited yours, feel free to connect and chat!</p>

					<p>As the final project in our Software Engineering course, the class was given the task of building a web

						love: Machi Koro! </p>

					<h3 class="major">PokeBattles</h3>
					<p>The third project of the Software Engineering Immersive Course at General Assembly. This is a team project
						where the goal is to create a RESTful Single-Page Application(SPA) that will have CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and
						DELETE(CRUD) functionality. As our very first software development project, this task was the perfect
						opportunity to experience what it will be like to work collaboratively in the real world.</p>
					<p>The theme we have chosen is Pokemon and it will be a smaller version of the classic game. As a user, the
						goal of the game is to win battles in order to evolve the Pokemon and then have the ability to attain more
						Pokemon to complete the Pokedex. </p>

					<h3 class="major">Instructor Journal</h3>
					<p>The goal for this project was to create a Full-stack application and I chose to design mine that has
						personal meaning and solves a real-world problem. My idea was to create an Instructor Journal where the
						instructors could share what was done in the classes.
						This information could then be stored on a database and in the future can be recalled such as searching how
						many new students the school enrolled in that particular year, or checking whether how a student is feeling
						after a particular injury.</p>

						project. We have been learning how to use the tools, and in this first project, we are finally able to build
						something. </p>

				<h2 class="major">Architectural</h2>
				<p>A range of different Architectural projects that I worked on during my time as an Architectural Designer.
				</p>
				<section class="project-section">
					<h3 class="major">Australia Post</h3>
					<p>Since the start of the retail rollout program in 2018, I was part of a small team with heavy involvement in
						the design and documentation of the stores. These projects allowed me the opportunity to see the complete
						life cycle from concept through to construction. This included inspecting the site to
						start the base build in Revit and also checking for
						defects before practical completion. </p>

					<h3 class="major">Auto & General</h3>
					<p>Although smaller in scale, this project required
						careful selection of materials, lighting, and thoughtful
						consideration of scale and ergonomics. As such, a
						lot of the documentation was in the details of joinery
						and working closely with the joiner and coordinating
						shop drawings. </p>

					<h3 class="major">Medibank</h3>
					<p>A careful balance between maintaining consistent

					<p>My main role was to assist in the documentation

						provide the best solutions for the client. Weekly construction meetings were held on site and
						site walkthroughs meant I had the opportunity to
						see and learn from builders directly. </p>
